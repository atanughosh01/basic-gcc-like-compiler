Consider a simple C-like language with

Data Types: integer, real and character

Declaration statements: identifiers are declared in declaration statements as basic data types and may also be assigned constant values (integer or floating)

Condition constructs: if, then, else. Relational operators used in the if statement are < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal) and != (not equal).

Example: if(a<10) then

a=a*a;

else a=a/2;

Nested statements are supported. There may be if statement without else statement.

Assignments to the variables are performed using the input/output constructs:
cin >> x   - Read into variable x

cout << x  - Write variable x to output

Arithmetic operators (+, - *, /, %) and assignment operator "=" are supported

Only function is main(), there is no other function.
The main() function does not contain arguments and no return statements.

Part I - Construct a CFG for this language.

Part II - Write a lexical analyser to scan the stream of characters from a program written in the above language and generate stream of tokens.

Part III - Maintain a symbol table with appropriate data structures.

Part IV - Write a bottom-up parser for this language (modules include Item-set construction, computation of FOLLOW, parsing table construction and parsing).
